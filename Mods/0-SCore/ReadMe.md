[ Change Log ]

Version: 20.2.60.742

	- Merged khzmusik's fix for infinite resource bug

 Version: 20.2.57.x
	- Loot task work.
	- SpawnCube breaks after trigger now.

Version: 20.2.56.x
	- Added more enhancements for SpawnCube2SDX. See blocks.xml for examples on advanced configuration.
	- Fixed issue with Sleepers not getting the correct buffs on waking up.
	- Fixed issue with Attack UAI being locked when target was still visible but not accessible.

Version: 20.2.55.x
	- Fixed issue with bad ray cast, causing NPCs to shoot through doors and walls
	- Multiple fixes to the BlockSpawnCube2SDX. This cube will allow you to spawn in a one-time entity.
		Example Usage:
	        <property name="Class" value="SpawnCube2SDX, SCore" />
			<!-- Will spawn NPC furiousRamsayBristonStart_FR, give them the buffOrderStay, pathing cube 0, and auto-assigns yourself as their leader -->
            <property name="Config" value="ec=FuriousRamsayBristonStart_FR;buff=buffOrderStay;pc=0;leader=true" />
			
			<!-- Will spawn the NPC and ordered to Stay. They do not have a pathing code, no leader -->
			<property name="Config" value="ec=FuriousRamsayBristonStart_FR;task=stay" />


		Note: There is a delay of about 5 seconds on MP servers for the leader to be auto-assigned.

	- Added support for new cvar called FailOnDistance.
		- If this cvar is set on the player, all hired NPCs will use this FailOnDistance range, rather than the one hard coded in the utilityai.
		- If this cvar is set on the NPC, then that NPC will use that range, instead of the one on the player or utilityai.


Version: 20.2.45
	- Added IsAlwaysAwake to be false. This allows Sleeping NPCs to be fully awake on spawn in.
		XML Property can be toggled with the following line:
			<property name="SleeperInstantAwake" value="false" />
			<property name="SleeperInstantAwake" value="true" />

	- Reduced the Auto-scan for pathing cubes to be a lot smaller (about a block away)
	- Default PathingCode is -1, so avoid this number, as its equivalent to not having a code.
	- Gave sleeping NPCs hearing for a threhold to wake them up.
	- Disable UAI when NPCs are sleeping

	- Slightly changed the consideration for InWeaponRange, to take in effect if it should shoot a player, if it could see it, but not reach it.
[ XUI ]
	- Added a few more bindings to npc stat window

Version: 20.2.44

	- Added toggle to turn on and off Advanced signs (0-SCore/Config/blocks.xml) to turn off gif / img support 
	- Moved Sign reading data to a universal class to allow EntityAliveSDX to re-use code
	- Added EntityAliveSDX to read from a nearby Pathing Cube
		Using the PathingCube (or PathingCube2) blocks, you can place an invisible sign near a sleeper
		Once placed, you can configure it as follows
			Task=stay  [ wander, guard, follow ] 
				- This will give the nearby EntityAliveSDX a starting order. 

				Example, you could put in Task=stay for NPCs that you want to behave like a turret

				Internally, the above tasks gives SCore's based-buffs  ( buffOrderStay, buffOrderWander, etc)
				Task can also be used to specify a general buff.

		Example: https://youtu.be/IuK_sN3WHZ4

	- Fixed a null ref where NPC following a NPC leader
		With this error fixed, the old herd spawner now works. This spawner is a special EntityClass that you can add to your sleeper volume, or in entitygroups, and will spawn multiple entities.
		This can be used, for example, to set up a Solider Group, which could have an officer, along with a few grunts. The soldiers will follow the officer around as they would if hired by a player.

		For this to work, you must give them the NPCHired, or equivalent, UAI. These do not need to be hirable by the player, but must contain the follow tasks.

		When you spawn in the SoldierPackMelee entity, it'll spawn the leader and followers.

		Example: https://youtu.be/OSlfwuX9r6Y

		EntityClasses.xml example:

		<append xpath="/entity_classes">
			<entity_class name="spawnerStub">
				<property name="Mesh" value="Gore/gore_block1_bonesPrefab"/>

			</entity_class>
		
			<!-- the Leader is spawned in first, then the Followers. The Followers set their Leader cvar to that of the Leader. -->
			<entity_class name="SoldierPackMelee" extends="spawnerStub">
				<property name="Prefab" value="Backpack"/>

				<property name="Followers" value="survivorSoldier1Club,survivorSoldier2Knife,survivorSoldier4Machete" param1="2,3"/>
				</property>
			</entity_class>

			</entity_class>
		</append>

		<requirement type="HasTask, SCore" requirementtype="Hide" value="LootBasic" /> <!-- True if this UAI Action Name is on the NPC -->

[ UAI Changes ]

	- Added new UAI Task called Guard. This task can replae the Stay action using IdleSDX.
		- Guard is similar to Stay and can be a replacement for Stay.
		- Two new MinEffectActions have been created for this, and is applied by the buff in the SCore's buffs.xml
			- MinEventActionGuardHere : This sets the NPC's guard position to match the player's current position, as well as the direction the player is looking.
			- MinEventActionGuardThere: This sets the NPC's guard position to match where the NPC is currently staying, with the look direction the same.
	- Added additional feature for the Wander UAI task:
		<task class="WanderSDX, SCore" interest="Loot:cntBirdnest"/>
	
		When interest is specified, there is a 30% chance triggering a TileEntity scan matching the value.
	
		For example, interest="Loot" will search for all Loot containers in the area, and pick one.
	
		If the TileEntity's entry has a :, that further allows filtering based on block name.
		
			<task class="WanderSDX, SCore" interest="Loot:cntBirdnest"/> <!-- scan for any loot container that has a block name that starts with cntBirdNest -->


		If interest is not specified, a standard wander is triggered.
		
	- Fixed a bug in AttackTarget where an NPC that was told to stay, would take a few steps out of position to attack

[ Mecanim Animation ]
	- Added simple null check when the entity using Mecanim is invalid.
