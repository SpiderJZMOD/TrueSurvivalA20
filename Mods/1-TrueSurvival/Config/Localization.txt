TrueSurvivalNutritionJournal_title,"True Survival: Nutrition"
TrueSurvivalNutritionJournal,"Most foods have added nutrition stats. They include Protein from Meat,  Fiber from Vegetables and Essential Vitamins from Fruit. These stats can be found on the foods stat info screen. Your lowest nutrition stat will determine your Diet so you will need to balance your nutrition consumption to stay healthy. To view your current nutrition stats open your character info screen and they will be located at the bottom. If any of your nutrition stats get too low or too high you will suffer unique illnesses depending on the stat and the level. To cure these illnesses either refrain from eating the instigating nutrition if caused by a high level or consume more if caused by a low level."
TrueSurvivalDamageJournal_title,"True Survival: Damage"
TrueSurvivalDamageJournal,"Damage works a little differently in True Survival. You will hurt yourself if you hit things with your bare hands so use tools and weapons. The material that your tools and weapons are made out of will determine how well they damage other materials. Damage progression is as follows - Wood<Stone<Iron<Steel - Lower materials will do little to no damage to higher materials. Traps and fire damage Zombies as normal but you can only damage Zombies with hits to the head."
TrueSurvivalHuntingJournal_title,"True Survival: Hunting"
TrueSurvivalHuntingJournal,"You will gain xp by hitting, killing and butchering non zombie animals. You can track your progression in your Skill Menu under Hunting. As you level each hunting skill you will receive more and better parts harvesting the animal. Once you have mastered a hunting skill you will be able to track them if they are nearby when you crouch."
TrueSurvivalRestAndHealingJournal_title,"True Survival: Rest and Healing"
TrueSurvivalRestAndHealingJournal,"Staying awake and alive is key in True Survival. As you play your Fatigue Level will rise slowly, lowering your max stamina and making you tire more quickly. To lower your Fatigue Level and raise your max stamina you will need to Rest on furniture or Sleep in beds. Be aware that you won't be able to rest or sleep while zombies are close by. The comfortableness of the furniture or bed will affect how fast your stats improve. While medical items will not heal you, sleeping in beds will raise your health slowly. The only other way to heal your health is eating foods or Natural Healing. Sleeping will also speed up healing on many injuries like Sprains and Bandaged Injuries and it will increase crafting speed."
TrueSurvivalDeadIsDeadJournal_title,"True Survival: Dead is Dead"

TrueSurvivalWorkbenchUpgradingJournal,"Workbenches that can craft quality tools and weapons each have a chain quest to help you craft or find the tools needed to upgrade each workbench. Once you have the needed tool hold it in your hand and use it as a tool on the workbench to upgrade it. This will make the upgraded workbench craft better quality items.
